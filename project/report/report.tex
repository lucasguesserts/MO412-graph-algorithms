\section{Is the graph multipartite?}

Nope, the graph is cyclic, so one person doesn't have to be an administrator to vote. For instance, \textit{BDD} voted for \textit{Miniapolis} and vice versa (in 2013).

Fabio said: perhaps that person was an admin, then left, then came back and run for adminship. Well, that is probably not the case since the cycle was found with all votes in 2013.

See the files \textit{BDD\_target\_votes.txt} and \textit{Miniapolis\_target\_votes.txt}
