# Degree distribution

## Description

Write a program to produce degree distribution plots for the phonecalls dataset.

- You should plot both the in-degree and the out-degree distributions, using log-log scales, but with the original values as labels;
- You may use any programming language and libraries you want;
- Please hand in both your code and the resulting figure (or figures);

## FAQ

1. Professor, the file `phonecalls.edgelist.txt` contains 2 columns, can we assume that each register is a phone call from ID in the first column to ID in the second column?
   1. Yes
2. Professor, that is not clear for me what you meant with "... but with the original values as labels". This means you want a plot like the one in the Slide 16 presented during the class?
   1. Exactly. Just like Slide 16 in Chap 2 Part 1. Or, equivalently, Fig 2-4(c) from the book.
3. Professor, can we submit the code and figure in pdf file?
   1. I prefer the code in source format, so that I can run it easily if needed.
