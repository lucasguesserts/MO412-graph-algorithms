# Cayley Tree

Consider Cayley Trees `T(k, P)` as defined in [Problem 4 of Barabasi's book, Chapter 3 on Random Networks](http://networksciencebook.com/chapter/3#homework3), for `k >= 3`:

1. Find a formula for the diameter `d_max(k, P)` of `T(k, P)` in terms of `k` and `P`.
2. Find a formula for the number of nodes `N(k, P)` of `T(k, P)` in terms of `k` and `P`.
3. For a fixed `k` which is different for each student (see below), plot a graph showing the values of `d_max(k, P)` and `ln(N(k, p))`, for `P` ranging `from 1 to 10`.  Do you see a tendency as P grows?

The attached table contains the values of `k` to be used by each student.  Find your first two initials in the table and use the corresponding value of `k`.
