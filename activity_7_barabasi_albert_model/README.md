# Activity 7 - Barabasi-Albert Model

## Problem Description

With the help of a computer, generate an undirected network with `N = 10000` nodes using the Barabasi-Albert model with `m = 4`. Use as initial condition a fully connected network with `4` nodes.

1. Measure the degree distribution at intermediate steps, namely, when the network has 100, 1000, and 10000 nodes.
2. Compare the cumulative degree distributions at these intermediate steps by plotting them together in a log-log plot and fitting each to a power-law by simple linear regression. Which degrees do you get?  Do they seem to approach the theoretical prediction?

Please hand in your code and figures.

## Solve the problem

```sh
$ python barabasi_albert_model.py
```
