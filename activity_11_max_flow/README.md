# Max Flow

Consider the flow network given by the files `nodes.csv` and `links.csv`, the last one containing rows of the form `u, v, c` meaning that the capacity of edge `(u,v)` is `c`. You job is to compute the value of a maximum flow in this flow network from `s` to `t`, where `s` is the node corresponding to your name's initial letters, and `t` is the node corresponding to your group partner's initial letters.

Please hand in the value of the maximum flow and the code you used to find the answer.
