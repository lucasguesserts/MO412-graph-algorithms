# Depth-First Search (DFS)

## Description

You have to perform a DFS in this network. Choose as initial node, the node corresponding to the two first initials of your name. Other than that, you may examine a node's neighbors (adjacency list) in any order, and re-start DFS at any not yet visited node.

You job is to return the two files with some extra information:

1. In the node file, on each row, replace the words 'start' and 'finish' by the starting and ending times of the corresponding node.
2. In the link file, on each row, replace 'tree/back/forward/cross' with the word that better conveys the type of corresponding edge.

Hand in these two files with the extra information in cvs format.

## Data

Two `.csv` files, one with the nodes and another with the edges of the same network.
